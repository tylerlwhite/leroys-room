      <p>Thanks for waking me up I slept in. Welcome to my bedroom. Snoop around to explore my work and clutter.</p>

      <p>A note on the state of things:</p>

      <p>My room is pretty sparse right now. I just moved in, and I am still working on my responsive furniture design
        skills. Eventually I am going to craft some prettier stuff or at least head to the discount sprite warehouse
        store.</p>

      <p>Future updates will include:</p>

      <p>A bookshelf with my writing and some of my favorite works from others, an arts and crafts area where my visual
        portfolio will exist, open access to my diary and deepest secrets, access to my laptop to view the rest of my
        work, and a a trash can</p>
    </div>

      <p>My desk is a little messy, that coffee has been sitting there for a few days.</p>
